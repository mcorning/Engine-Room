## Notes

- Lower priority than the F-150 loan but still part of core SSC debt service  
    
- Tends to be paid mid-month after room/board and Verizon are handled  
    
- If SSC funds are insufficient, consider postponing or partial pay if allowed  
    
- Avoid covering with MSFT unless it’s a clean surplus month
