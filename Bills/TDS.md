> [!NOTE] Enroll in Autopay
> We cancelled autopay for the 8/1 pay date and paid it today with Citi Diamond. So next month re enroll using the citi card.

> UPDATE: got Statement with two months due. Autopay was not setup until now. used **Shield Visa**. But got a cutoff notice for past due, so paid two months on Visa at 9/30/25.
